# Introduction

## Disclaimer

This project is in early stages of development. **Do not use it on any mainnet with real assets**.

## What is BAF Wallet?

BAF wallet is a **non-custodial** discord bot that allows community managers to send tokens and NFTs to members of a discord community. This includes things like:

- participation badges
- competition prizes
- community role tokens
- reputation tokens, if you're into that sort of thing
- plain old payments
- and more!

## Usage

If you already have a discord community where the BAF wallet bot has been added, do `%help` for instructions on how to use it. 

We do not yet support adding our instance of the bot to discords other than the BAF discord. If you want to use it in your community, you currently must deploy your own. This will change soon.

If you want to deploy your own instance of the bot, please see the [deployment guide](./Deployment.md).

If you're technical, want to know how it works, and/or ensure it's non-custodial, please see [how it works](./how-it-works/Overview.md)
